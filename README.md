# RAG-Enhanced-Resume-Scorer-for-ATS-Systems
## 🚀 New Project Launch:
RAG-Enhanced Resume Scorer for ATS Systems
🧠 Powered by Google Gemini 2.5 Flash & Streamlit

🔍 Ever wondered if your resume can pass through an ATS (Applicant Tracking System) before it reaches a recruiter?

📄 I’ve built a tool that analyzes your resume using Generative AI and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to:

✅ Calculate your resume’s ATS score (out of 100)
✅ Highlight strengths like relevant skills, formatting, and keyword usage
✅ Give clear, actionable suggestions to boost your visibility in automated screening systems

💡 How It Works:
Upload your resume (PDF/TXT)

The app extracts content and sends it to a Gemini AI model

Gemini returns:

ATS score

Key highlights

Detailed suggestions for improvement

🔁 All done in real time with Streamlit UI and API-secured backend using .env.

## 🎯 Why this matters?
Most job seekers don’t realize that over 70% of resumes are filtered out by ATS bots before a human sees them.

This tool helps:

Job seekers improve their interview chances

Career coaches give quantitative feedback

HR tech startups build smarter resume tools
